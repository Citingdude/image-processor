# Go Image Processor üñºÔ∏è‚ö°

A simple HTTP service written in Go that accepts an uploaded image, processes it (e.g., grayscale, pixelate, add text), and returns the transformed image.

This is a learning project to explore:
- Go's `net/http` server
- File uploads & multipart forms
- Image decoding & encoding
- Basic image manipulation
- Streaming binary data in HTTP responses

## üöÄ Features

- **Upload images** via HTTP POST
- **Process images** (start with grayscale, then experiment with other effects)
- **Return processed image** directly as a response
- Minimal dependencies, mostly standard library
